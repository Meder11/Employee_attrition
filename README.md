I just completed a full HR Attrition Dashboard in Power BI — here’s what I found!
Using Power BI, I analyzed 1,000 employee records to uncover attrition patterns and engagement risks.
🔍 Key Insights:
16.12% attrition — mostly in Sales & Lab roles
153 high-risk employees flagged (under 30, overtime, low satisfaction)
Employees with poor Work-Life Balance left at 2x the rate
🛠 Tools: Power BI (DAX, Decomposition Tree, Smart KPIs)
📈 Outcome: A data-driven retention strategy that HR teams can act on
